# ConvexHull-and-Intersections
This project visualizes computational geometry, including convex hull construction and line segment intersection detection. Using Bentley-Ottmann, Graham Scan, Jarvis March, Brute Force, Quickhull, and Monotone Chain algorithms, it features an interactive Streamlit interface for dynamic point and segment manipulation.
